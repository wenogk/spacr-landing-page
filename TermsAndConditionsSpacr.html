<h1><strong>Spacr Terms and Conditions </strong></h1>
<p>Last updated: 2/5/2021</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to Spacr</strong></p>
<p>We are Spacr, Inc. (&ldquo;Spacr,&rdquo; &ldquo;Us,&rdquo; &ldquo;We,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our&rdquo;), and we are a platform that helps to define, create and connect a global community of friends and colleagues who not only want to celebrate shared interests, but who also want to minimize cultural, geographic and social divisions between them through online and offline communications and interactions. Our friends and our community are bound together by many things, including a desire to share items, goods, products or services (which we call &ldquo;Listed Items&rdquo;) between those who may seek to obtain them globally (whom we call &ldquo;Senders&rdquo;) and those willing to help bring them to their friends, whom we call &ldquo;Travelers&rdquo;). We do this through our website, located at https://Spacr.io, and through our applications, which may be available from third party sites for various mobile and computing devices, and through our products, services and information, all of which we collectively refer to as the &ldquo;Spacr Platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, THEY CONSTITUTE A CONTRACT AND CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AS DETAILED IN THE SECTION TITLED </strong><a href="https://grabr.io/en/terms#arbitration"><u><strong>ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></u></a><strong> BELOW. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.</strong></p>
<p>These Terms of Use are a contract, and contain important information about Your legal rights, remedies and obligations, and they incorporate and include the <u>Spacr Privacy Policy</u>, all of which You should read carefully and all of which we collectively refer to as the &ldquo;Terms.&rdquo; Your agreement with Us depends upon how you use Our Platform, either as a Spacer, Sender, or as a Traveller, or both. References to &ldquo;You&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your&rdquo; mean the person (s) who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Spacr Platform in any way, and each of their heirs, successors and assigns. By accessing or using any part of our Platform, which includes without limitation as Senders, Travelers or persons accessing or searching the Spacr Platform, you are agreeing to the Terms, and incorporated documents.</p>
<p><strong>Modification or Changes to the Spacr Platform, the Terms of Use and Incorporated Documents</strong></p>
<p>We are continually changing and improving the Spacr Platform. We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify it, to add or remove features or functionalities or to suspend or terminate any part or all of the Spacr Platform with or without notice to you. We may also modify or amend these Terms or incorporated documents to reflect changes in the law, changes to the Spacr Platform, Fees (defined below) or any other aspect of the relationship between Spacr and You. You should look at the Terms regularly.</p>
<p>If we make changes to these Terms, or any other document incorporated by reference here, we will post the changes to the Terms of Use pages of our Platform, send you a message or otherwise attempt to notify you. Amendments are effective no sooner than thirty (30) days after we post them on the Spacr Platform for existing users and immediately for all the new users joining and accepting the terms after and on the day these amendments are posted, unless we notify You otherwise. If You do not agree to the Terms, including as changed or modified, We will be sorry to see you go, but Your only recourse is to stop using or accessing the Spacr Platform.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility and Use of the Platform</strong></p>
<p>Access to and use of the Spacr Platform is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old, who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law, and who properly create a valid account as explained below (valid account holders, whether Spacers. Senders, Travelers or all, may also collectively be referred to in these Terms as &ldquo;Members&rdquo;). By accessing or using the Spacr Platform, You represent and warrant that you are eligible to do so.</p>
<p>YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, UNLESS WE OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY AGREE IN WRITING, SPACR IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF OFFERING, SELLING, PURCHASING, OR BRINGING SHARED ITEMS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ACCESSING THE SPACR PLATFORM, AND IN BECOMING A MEMBER, YOU RECEIVE ONLY THE ABILITY TO USE THE SPACR PLATFORM TO ACCESS FRIENDS WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN BEING A SENDER AND/OR TRAVELER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ABILITY TO MESSAGE OTHER MEMBERS ABOUT ITEMS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SPACR IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY RELATIONSHIP OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ANOTHER MEMBER, AND THAT ANY SUCH RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE MEMBERS ONLY.

<p>Members also acknowledge and agree that they are users of the Spacr Platform only, and that they are not Spacr employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents whatsoever. Spacr does not have the right to control and does not control Members, or the relationships between them or the subject matter of such relationships. You acknowledge and agree that, except where these Terms provide otherwise, it is the Members themselves who establish any applicable Traveler Fees. While Spacr may help facilitate disputes, We have no control over and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any carried Item arranged between Members, (ii) the truth, accuracy or suitability of any description or any other aspect referred to by Members on the Spacr Platform, (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party or (iv) the legality or compliance with laws, rules, regulations, orders and decisions that may be applicable to any relationship between Members or the subject matter thereof. While we may provide information that may be helpful in assisting you to evaluate another Member, and their status in the Spacr community, Spacr does not endorse any particular Member or any listed Item. Any reference to a Member being &ldquo;Verified&rdquo; (or similar language) only indicates that the Member has completed a verification or identification process and nothing else.</p>
<p>To promote the Spacr Platform and to increase exposure to potential Members or their desired trips and items, content from the Spacr Platform may be displayed on other websites, applications, other communications (including email or SMS or other text message services), and in online and offline advertisements. To assist Members who speak other languages, content from the Spacr Platform may be translated, in whole or in part, into other languages and where done so, Spacr does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of such translations and Members are responsible for reviewing and verifying the accuracy of them.</p>

You are only eligible to have one (1) Account at a time, and are not allowed to transfer Your account at any time to another person or entity. As indicated above, by doing so, You represent and warrant that you are over the age of eighteen (18) and are capable of entering into legally binding agreements in the relevant jurisdiction (s).</p>

If we undertake an effort to verify Your background through these or other methods (which we are not obligated to do under these Terms), and choose to identify you as &ldquo;Verified,&rdquo; such a notation shall mean nothing other than that You completed a verification or identification process and shall not constitute an endorsement of You or any other Member to the public or to any Member.</p>

<p><strong>Payment Terms and Appointment of Spacr as Limited Payment Collection Agent</strong></p>
<p><strong>Payments-Related Representations and Warranties</strong></p>
<p>As set forth above, except where we otherwise specifically agree in writing, Spacr does not own, create, sell, offer, resell, provide, control, manage, buy, offer to buy, bring, or offer to bring or supply any listed Items or any other tangible or intangible thing that You may discuss with another Member. When Senders and Travelers make or accept an offer to transact, they are entering into a contract with each other, and even though Spacr may act as a limited payment collection agent as defined below, it is not a party to any agreement discussed or entered into between Members.</p>
<p>Spacr may restrict the availability of payment services, or any aspect or feature of payment services, to perform maintenance of systems to help ensure the proper functioning of the system or to improve, enhance, modify, suspend or terminate any payment service, or to introduce new or additional services at any time, including through additional third parties. The payment-related services may contain links to certain third-party websites, applications, services or resources (&ldquo;Third Party Services&rdquo;). Any such Third Party Services are subject to different terms or conditions and privacy practices created or controlled by third party providers and not Spacr, and Members should review them carefully and independently. Spacr is not responsible for or liable for the availability, accuracy, reliability or anything related to Third Party Services, including the content thereon. Links or other access to information of Third Party Service providers shall not constitute an endorsement by Spacr of such providers or their services.</p>
<p>You may not use Spacr&rsquo;s payment related services except as authorized by the laws of the UAE, the laws of the jurisdiction where you reside, and any other applicable laws. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, Spacr&rsquo;s payment related services may not be used to send or receive funds or currency into any United Arab Emirate&rsquo;s embargoed countries; By agreeing to these Terms, by accessing and/or using the Spacr Platform, you further represent and warrant that (i) neither you nor the subject of your transaction (e.g., items, goods, products, services, tangible or intangible things) are located in a country that is subject to a United Arab Emirate&rsquo;s Government embargo, or that has been designated by the UAE Government as a &ldquo;terrorist supporting&rdquo; country; and (ii) that you are not listed on any UAE&rsquo;s list of prohibited or restricted parties. Additionally, notwithstanding your agreement to the above relating to the laws of the United States of America and its subdivisions, localities and municipalities, you also hereby agree to comply fully with relevant export and import and customs laws in your local country and jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Appointment of Spacr as Limited Payment Collection Agent</strong></p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, and in accessing or using the Spacr Platform, Travelers appoint Spacr as their respective limited payment collection agent, authorized to receive and collect payments for transactions entered into between Members, including (i) Item Costs, (ii) Spacr Service Fees, (iii) Traveler&rsquo;s Fees, (iv) Acceleration Fees, if any, and (iv) Taxes and other Government Regulatory Fees (for example, without limitation duties, tariffs or government charges) (&ldquo;Total Fees&rdquo;) owed by Senders to Travelers as set forth in these Terms. Payments made by Senders to Spacr in connection with an Offer shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to Travelers, and Travelers agree to transport the listed Items for senders in the agreed-upon manner as if the Traveler has received payment directly from senders. You further agree that Spacr&rsquo;s obligation to remit payments to Travelers is conditioned upon and extends only to sums that it has successfully received from senders in accordance with the relevant agreements, and also that in accepting appointment as the limited payment collection agent, Spacr assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of Senders or Travelers, Members or any other person. As limited payment collection agent, Spacr assumes no liability or obligation for any funds or obligations owed by Senders that were not collected by Spacr in its role under this Paragraph.</p>
<p>Each Sender and Traveler acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding the fact that Spacr is not a party to the agreement between Travelers and Senders, Spacr acts as the Travelers payment collection agent for the limited purpose of accepting collection from Senders on behalf of the Traveler. Upon Senders remittance to Spacr, Sender&rsquo;s payment obligation to the Traveler for agreed upon amounts is extinguished, and Spacr is responsible for remitting funds collected to Travelers in the agreed upon manner. In the event that Spacr does not remit such amounts, Travelers' recourse is only against Spacr, and not senders directly.</p>
<p>If any Member does not make a payment properly, or if Spacr cannot properly charge a payment method on file with it, or any other payment method for any reason, Spacr expressly reserves all rights under applicable law to recover payment as well as all of its costs and expenses incurred, including reasonable attorneys' or other professionals' fees, in pursuing such payment (s).</p>
<p><strong>Transactions Between Senders and Travelers on Spacr</strong></p>
<p>Spacr strives to make the Spacr Platform useful, simple and efficient. Spacr senders located globally may gain access to friends who have better availability to carry Items in other markets who may be fully willing to bring these items to their Spacr friends and colleagues. Through the Spacr Platform, Spacr helps to bring diverse groups of people together, and hopefully, to minimize the differences and divisions that can accumulate over time, geographical distance and cultures.</p>
<p>As set forth more fully below, in a typical transaction facilitated on the Spacr Platform, the Traveller publishes an listing called a &ldquo;Sender Request '' which identifies desired Listed Items. Interested Travelers or Travelers matched by the Spacr Platform, may then make offers to bring Listed Items on terms expressed between Members in a &ldquo;Traveler&rsquo;s Offer.&rdquo; When agreed upon, execution of the &ldquo;Sender&rsquo;s Acceptance, fixes the final and binding agreement between the Members.</p>
<p><strong>The Sender Request</strong></p>
<p>After finding an Item of interest, Senders must create a valid Sender&rsquo;s Request. The Sender&rsquo;s Request is made when the Sender uses the Spacr Platform submission tool to (i) describe the item specifically including the price; (ii) to add the location (City and Country) where the Sender is or where they want the Listed Items brought, and (iii) to add the desired receipt date. Spacr advises Senders to be as specific as possible, and provides a place to &ldquo;Include a Note to Your Traveler&rdquo; to help ensure that a Traveler obtains and brings only the desired item. Senders shall not request Prohibited Listed Items.</p>
<p><strong>Prohibited Listed Items</strong></p>
<p>Spacr Senders expressly agree not to use the Spacr Platform or to request that a Traveler obtain or bring any item that is prohibited under the laws of the UAE and/or its subdivisions, or of any international laws or laws of any local jurisdiction applicable to Members, goods, transit or destination. It is the responsibility of <strong>both</strong> the Sender (and not Spacr) to refrain from requesting or bringing any Item that is prohibited either by the jurisdiction of disembarkation, transit or embarkation. Prohibited items include, but are not limited, to:</p>
<p>Hazardous Materials as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or by the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), United States Customs and Borders Protection (CBP), United States Department of Homeland Security or similar agencies, national, state and local.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Spacr recommends that Senders and Travelers consult their respective government agencies which regulate items that may and may not be brought into or out of a country of origin, such as <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring"><u>lists maintained by the United States Transportation Security Agency, (TSA)</u></a>. All travel from the UAE, and packing related thereto, shall comply with all applicable <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/"><u>TSA Rules</u></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested Traveler Fees</strong></p>
<p>When the Sender creates a Sender&rsquo;s Request, the Spacr Platform may auto-calculate a suggested, optimal Traveler Fee, for illustrative purposes in planning the Sender&rsquo;s transaction. As explained below in the section &ldquo;Fees,&rdquo; the actual Traveler Fee on any given transaction is set entirely by the Traveler and may be more than, or less than the suggested Traveler Fee.Spacr reserves the right to fix fee (per kg) for certain routes and destinations</p>
<p><strong>The Travelers Offer</strong></p>
<p>To assist Members to locate and communicate with each other, including potentially dates upon which Members can meet in person, The Spacr Platform allows Travelers to enter the details of upcoming travel dates, and to browse Sender&rsquo;s Requests made by their Spacr friends. Travelers can indicate their preference to be notified of upcoming Senders' Requests that may correspond to their planned trips, or trips that they may be willing to take.</p>
<p>Upon finding a suitable Sender&rsquo;s Request, Traveler must submit a &ldquo;Traveler&rsquo;s Offer&rdquo;. The Traveler&rsquo;s Offer must contain and describe <strong>Each </strong>component of the Total Fees:</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
<p>The following components that make up the Total Fees must be contained in, and fully described in the Traveler&rsquo;s Offer. When Accepted, the Traveler&rsquo;s Offer establishes the final and total amounts to which the Sender agrees.</p>
<p>(i) Traveler&rsquo;s Fee: The Traveler&rsquo;s Fee is the amount Senders agree to give to their Traveler friends for helping the Sender. As set forth above, Spacr may estimate a Traveler&rsquo;s Fee for planning purposes, but the actual Traveler&rsquo;s Fee is set by the Traveler in the Offer. The Service Fee and Traveler&rsquo;s Fee may collectively be referred to by Spacr as the &lsquo;&rsquo;Platform Fees&rsquo;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(ii) Service Fee: This is a service fee charged by and retained by Spacr for the use of its Spacr Platform by Senders and Travelers. Service Fees are collected by Spacr from Senders and deducted from remaining amounts remitted to Travelers by Spacr as the Traveler&rsquo;s limited payment collection agent as described above. Service Fees are non-refundable</p>
<p>(iii) Acceleration Fee: The Expedited Fee, if any, may be added to Listed Items with the consent of both Sender and Traveler to accelerate the time in which Travelers may obtain and bring Listed Items.</p>
<p>(v) Applicable Taxes: Spacr may auto-calculate an estimate of sales and other taxes associated with the Traveler&rsquo;s Offer. Spacr always separately states the Applicable Taxes from the Item Cost, and the Platform Fees.</p>
<p>(vi) All government fees, tariffs and duties are the responsibility of the Traveler and Traveler is required to make sure that the Sender is aware of such fees prior to accepting the offer.</p>
<p><strong>Import Restrictions and Charges</strong></p>
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the Travelers to be familiar with, to specify, and to include in the Traveler&rsquo;s Offer, <a href="https://help.grabr.io/hc/articles/115004005394"><u>any and all applicable customs duties, tariffs, and charges applicable to Listed Items</u></a>. Although not exhaustive, Spacr may provide links to certain government and third party sites where Members can find out more information about their travel destinations and rules and regulations applicable to their travel, including:</p>

<p><strong>Sender&rsquo;s Acceptance</strong></p>
<p>When the Sender and Traveler have agreed to all aspects, including applicable timing and Total Fees, the Sender must agree to the Traveler&rsquo;s Offer, in what we call the &ldquo;Sender&rsquo;s Acceptance.&rdquo; The Sender&rsquo;s Acceptance is an agreement on all material terms between a Sender and Traveler, under which they agree to be bound to each other to in the manner agreed.</p>
<p><strong>Ownership, Acceptance, Risk of Loss and Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Members acknowledge and agree that except where prohibited by applicable law or otherwise agreed to by Members, it is the Travelers, and not Senders, who own Listed Items and must maintain for presentment all original receipts evidencing such ownership. Members also acknowledge and agree that to the maximum extent allowed by law, the risk of loss remains with the Traveler unless and until the Traveler has completed all of the obligations under his or her agreement with the Sender, which includes bringing the items as agreed.</p>
<p>Spacr recommends that Senders and Travelers procure their own insurance to cover the cost and expenses relating to a listing. Spacr may, but is not obligated to recommend or to offer links where Senders and/or Traveler&rsquo;s may procure insurance relating to their listing.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance of Listed Items</strong></p>
<p>The Sender and Travelers must agree at the time the Sender&rsquo;s Request is accepted by the Traveler on a specific time period for acceptance of the Listed items. Travelers shall bear the responsibility to identify an acceptable safe and public place to meet with their Senders for the purpose of inspection and exchange of goods. The time for delivery can be extended only by written agreement between the Sender and Traveler on the Spacr Platform, or by Spacr. Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, it is the Sender&rsquo;s obligation to inspect and accept the Listed items at the time of delivery, and the agreement between the parties is deemed complete at the time of acceptance regardless of whether the Sender shows up to inspect and accept Listed items. Unless the Traveler and Sender have agreed otherwise in writing, if the goods are not made available for delivery and acceptance within five (5) days of the delivery date, and the Sender has not inspected and accepted the Listed Items, the Sender&rsquo;s Payment Method will be charged and the amounts released to the Traveler. The only permissible method to extend the delivery, inspection and acceptance periods agreed to by the Sender and Traveler is written communication between the parties on the Spacr Platform or through notification by Spacr through the Spacr Platform.</p>
<p><strong>Rejection and Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Traveler&rsquo;s may refuse to accept the Listed items only if the Sender has brought incorrect goods (for example, specifications which differ from the agreement between the parties, in terms of brand, color, style, size, etc.) or the condition of the Listed items is other than that agreed to between the parties (for example, damaged or used items or otherwise not in the condition represented). Traveler may not refuse acceptance of Listed items because they changed their mind about the transaction, or through an attempt to renegotiate the price of the items or because they have found the items elsewhere. Senders and Travelers agree that Spacr, in its sole discretion, may determine whether the reason for rejection is acceptable under applicable policies and if Spacr determines the rejection is impermissible or unauthorized, Travelers agree that their Payment Method may be charged and the transaction completed as agreed to by the parties. Except as set forth above, in instances where the Sender fails to appear for inspection and acceptance within five (5) days of the delivery date, Senders are required to confirm inspection and acceptance of Listed items in the Spacr messaging on the Platform in order to release funds to Travelers.</p>
<p><strong>Instant Delivery</strong></p>
<p>In Spacr&rsquo;s sole discretion, it may offer Senders and Travelers the option to request, pay for and perform an &ldquo;Instant Delivery&rdquo; where Members can agree to all relevant terms up front without negotiation. With Instant Deliver, when enabled, the Sender Requests Listed Items, and agrees that his or her chosen payment method will be charged for the full amount of Total Fees upon the Traveler&rsquo;s Acceptance. With Instant De;ivery, the Sender, and not the Traveler, establishes or confirms all components of the Total Fees at the time of the Sender&rsquo;s Offer, including the Item Cost, the Service Fee, the Traveler&rsquo;s Fee, the Acceleration Fee (if applicable), the Applicable Taxes. All Total Fees are established when the Sender makes the offer and the Sender&rsquo;s payment method is charged at the time of the Traveler&rsquo;s acceptance.</p>
<p>Travelers who wish to perform an Instant Delivery can select one or more Instant Delivery that correspond to their chosen or preferred travel, and agree that they will receive only the amounts specified in the Sender&rsquo;s Instant Delivery Offer. For example, a Traveler accepting an Instant delivery will not be able to adjust the Item Cost or the suggested Traveler Fees when an Instant Delivery is accepted by the Traveler. Senders remain responsible at all times for paying the Total Fees, including the non-refundable Service Fee, as specified in the Instant Delivery.</p>
<p>Spacr may offer alternative options for the timing and manner of payment for Listed Items, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>If Spacr is unable to collect any amounts due from Senders under these Terms via the chosen payment method, Sender authorize Spacr to charge any other payment method on file with Spacr (unless any have been previously removed or the authorization to charge them has been previously rescinded). Sender&rsquo;s also expressly authorize Spacr to recover any costs and expenses it incurs in collecting any Total Fees not paid or collected via your chosen payment method that remain due and owing. Spacr is not responsible for any fees or charges that a third party payment processor may impose when payment methods are charged or disputed, and disclaims all such liability.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please Read this Section Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit In Court.</strong></p>
<p>You and Spacr agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; means any dispute, claim or controversy between us that arises out of this agreement, or the use of the Spacr platform, or the relationship between us, regardless of legal theory and includes claims that accrued before the date You entered into this agreement as well as claims relating to the interpretation, validity, enforcement or scope of the agreement to arbitrate disputes contained in this Section. The term &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; is to be interpreted in the broadest sense allowed by law. The only disputes excluded from this broad provision are claims that can be resolved in Small Claims Court and certain intellectual property claims, as provided below.</p>
<p>By agreeing to these Terms, You agree to resolve any and all disputes with Spacr as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution:</strong> Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration or litigation. You can reach Spacr&rsquo;s support department by sending a request to spacr.info@gmail.com. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve all disputes in good faith negotiations between them, which both agree is a precondition to either initiating an arbitration or lawsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> If we cannot resolve the dispute with You within thirty (30) days of when You start informal dispute resolution, then the dispute must be resolved by binding arbitration which may be begun by either You or Spacr. All claims or disputes arising out of or relating to these Provider Terms (including the Terms' or Privacy Policy&rsquo;s formation, performance, and breach), Your relationship with Spacr and/or Your use of the Spacr Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/"><u>Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules</u></a>, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. (If Your claim exceeds $250,000, You and Spacr agree that the JAMS' <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/"><u>Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures</u></a> will apply, excluding rules or procedures governing or permitted class or representative actions). The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all such disputes and has the power to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Arbitration.</strong> To start an arbitration, You must do the following: (a) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages You seek to recover (You may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, California 94111; and &copy; send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Spacr at (spacr.info@gmail.com)</p>
<p>You and Spacr each understand that, absent the mandatory arbitration provision in this Section, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You also acknowledge that You are giving up the right to a jury trial and understand that the costs of arbitration and right to pre-trial discovery is more limited than many courts permit.</p>
<p><strong>Location of Arbitration.</strong> We both agree that arbitration between Spacr and Providers shall take place in the (UAE)</p>
<p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> Providers and Spacr each agrees that any and all arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis or any other representative basis. YOU AND SPACR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver above is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p><strong>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims:</strong> Notwithstanding Your and Spacr&rsquo;s decision to resolve all disputes through mandatory arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the United Arab Emirates Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (&ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Survival.</strong> This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section will not be affected by any termination of Your Account or the Spacr Platform and will survive termination of the relationship between You and Spacr.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
<p>We respect and expect Providers and Parents to respect copyright law. Where warranted, we will terminate the Account of any user who repeatedly infringes or is believed to be repeatedly infringing the rights of copyright holders.</p>

<p><strong>General Terms</strong></p>
